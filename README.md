# Slot Machine Game

# Overview

This is a simple Python-based slot machine game where players can deposit money, place bets, and spin the reels to win based on matching symbols. The project was created as a hands-on exercise to practice Python programming concepts.

# Features

- Deposit System: Users can input an initial deposit to start the game.
- Customizable Bets: Players can choose the number of lines to bet on and the bet amount per line.
- Randomized Spins: Each spin generates random symbols with varying probabilities.
- Winning Calculation: Calculates winnings based on bet amount and matched symbols on specific lines.
- Replay Option: Players can choose to play multiple rounds as long as they have a balance.

# Rules

1. Lines: Players can bet on 1 to 3 lines.
2. Symbols: The slot machine uses symbols with different frequencies:
   - `A`: High frequency, high value
   - `B`: Moderate frequency and value
   - `C`: Lower frequency, moderate value
   - `D`: Lowest frequency, highest value
3. Winning Lines: A line wins if all symbols in that line match.
